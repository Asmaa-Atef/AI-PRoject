              Data Science is an interdisciplinary field whose primary objective
              is the extraction of meaningful knowledge and insights from data.
              These insights are extracted with the help of various mathematical
              and Machine Learning-based algorithms. Hence, Machine Learning is
              a key element of Data Science.

              Machine Learning is a subset or a part of Artificial Intelligence.
              It primarily involves the scientific study of algorithmic,
              mathematical, and statistical models which performs a specific
              task by analyzing data, without any explicit step-by-step
              instructions, by relying on patterns and inference, which is drawn
              from the data. This also contributes to its alias, Pattern
              Recognition.

              Artificial Intelligence is a vast field made up of
              multidisciplinary subjects, which aims to artificially create
              “intelligence” to machines, similar to that displayed by humans
              and animals. The term is used to describe machines that mimic
              cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving.
