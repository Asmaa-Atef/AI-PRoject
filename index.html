          Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer
          science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing
          tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an
          interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements
          in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in
          virtually every sector of the tech industry.

          Artificial General Intelligence The creation of a machine with
          human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy
          Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for AGI has been fraught
          with difficulty. The search for a "universal algorithm for learning
          and acting in any environment," (Russel and Norvig 27) isn't new, but
          time hasn't eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine
          with a full set of cognitive abilities. AGI has long been the muse of
          dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun
          humanity, but experts agree it's not something we need to worry about
          anytime soon.
